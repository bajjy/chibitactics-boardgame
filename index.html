        <h1>Chibitactics: Official Rulebook</h1>

        <p class="intro">
            Welcome, brave adventurer, to the Abyss – a realm where reality bends and ancient powers stir. Chibitactics is not merely a game; it is a crucible where strategic minds clash, where the fate of nascent worlds hangs in the balance, and where even the most cunning plans can unravel in a cascade of temporal paradoxes. Assemble your chosen vanguard, delve into the shifting landscapes, and prepare to outwit, outmaneuver, and utterly dominate your foes. This tome, though humble in appearance, holds the keys to understanding this strange and perilous existence. Read, learn, and perhaps, survive.
        </p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>WARNING:</strong> Chibitactics is currently in beta. Game balance and gameplay mechanics may be subject to change. You may encounter errors, bugs, imbalances, and situations not explicitly described in these rules. Consider this less a finished manuscript and more a living grimoire. Your feedback, bug reports, and recommendations are highly appreciated and can be sent to: chibiepic.com@gmail.com. We appreciate your contribution to the ongoing madness.
        </div>

        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Players:</strong> 2+ (The more, the merrier the chaos!)</li>
            <li><strong>Game Session:</strong> Approximately 80 minutes (Time flies when you're resurrecting allies and binding enemies!)</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> 12+ (Requires a mind capable of tactical brilliance and a strong stomach for existential dread.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Every faction, unit, and tile in Chibitactics possesses unique properties, offering players hundreds of distinct paths to victory. Each game session promises to be unlike the last, thanks to dynamic global events that reshape the world each round. One moment you're traversing a serene forest, the next, it's a bubbling swamp. Adapt or be consumed!
        </p>

        <h3>Resolving Disputes</h3>
        <p>
            Ah, the inevitable clash of interpretations! Any disagreements or ambiguities between players during the game should be resolved either through a collective vote (the democratic path to doom) or by a simple dice roll (the path of pure, glorious chance). All players are responsible for upholding the rules and ensuring fair play. This collaborative approach ensures the game remains fair and engaging for everyone, even when someone's favorite unit is unexpectedly devoured by a sentient mushroom.
        </p>

        <h3>Game Components</h3>
        <p>
            Before starting, ensure you have all the necessary components for Chibitactics. Misplacing a component is a rookie mistake, and the Abyss is not kind to rookies.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Faction Decks:</strong> In the starter set, there are 3 faction decks (Humans, Chthonids, Fungoids). Each deck contains unit cards specific to that faction.
                <ul>
                    <li>**Instruction Cards:** Located within the faction decks, these cards describe the unique features and abilities of each faction. Keep these handy; forgetting your racial ability is like forgetting your own name in a dimension where names have power.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Savage Deck:</strong> A collection of aggressive inhabitants of this world that you will encounter during exploration. Detailed information about Savages can be found on their instruction card (look for it in the Savage deck). Beware, for these creatures are not to be trifled with, unless you enjoy being dismembered.</li>
            <li><strong>Character Tokens:</strong> Each unit card has a corresponding physical token that represents the unit on the game board. These are your pawns in this grand, macabre dance.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Segments (Map Tiles):</strong> These are hexagonal pieces that form the dynamic game map. They shift, they change, they conspire against you.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Deck:</strong> This deck contains cards dictating global phenomena that affect the world, occurring once per round. These are the whims of the Abyss, often cruel, sometimes surprisingly beneficial.</li>
            <li><strong>Six-sided Die:</strong> A standard die used for various rolls throughout the game. Your fate, and the fate of your units, often rests on its tumble.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Setup and Start</h2>

        <h3>Setting Up the Game Board</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Shuffle Map Segments:</strong> Thoroughly shuffle all game segments (map tiles). A poorly shuffled map is a predictable map, and predictability is the enemy of fun (and survival).</li>
            <li><strong>Lay Out Face-Down:</strong> Arrange the shuffled segments face-down (backside up) in a pattern agreed upon by the players. The size and shape of the playing field can be customized by mutual agreement. Feel free to craft your own little pocket of impending doom.</li>
            <li><strong>Place Starting Segments:</strong> Place one designated starting segment (marked as such) face-up for each player. These are typically placed openly at the beginning. Consider them your tiny, temporary bastions against the encroaching unknown.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Choosing Factions and Squads</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Faction Selection:</strong> Players choose their faction (Humans, Chthonids, or Fungoids). The corresponding faction deck is assigned to that player. Choose wisely, for your destiny is intertwined with your faction's very essence.</li>
            <li><strong>Unit Selection:</strong> Without showing each other, players draw unit cards from their chosen faction's deck to form their squad.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recommended Squad Size:</strong> It is recommended that each player's squad consists of 4 units, but the exact number can always be agreed upon by the players. A smaller squad means fewer targets, but also fewer bodies to throw at the problem.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Faction and Unit Details:</strong> The unique features of each faction, as well as the specific abilities and behaviors of individual units, can be found on their respective instruction cards. Memorize them; they are your gospel.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Determining Turn Order</h3>
        <p>
            Players must decide who takes the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by rolling the die (highest roll goes first). If there are more than two players, play proceeds clockwise from the first player. The first move often dictates the flow of battle, so don't be shy about rolling for initiative!
        </p>

        <h2>Core Gameplay Mechanics</h2>

        <h3>Player and Unit Turns</h3>
        <p>
            Units within a player's squad possess various skills, and a unit's turn is spent utilizing these skills. Every action counts in the Abyss, so plan your moves like a master puppeteer.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Unit Activation:</strong> On your turn, you activate one of your units to perform an action.</li>
            <li><strong>Skill Usage:</strong> A unit's turn is primarily spent using one of its skills, as detailed on its Unit Card.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>One Skill Per Turn (Generally):</strong> Typically, a unit's turn ends after it uses one of its skills. However, certain skill categories, Event Cards, or faction abilities may allow a unit to perform additional actions or continue its turn (e.g., Melee skills can often be used after Movement skills). Don't be afraid to chain abilities for maximum impact!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Faction Ability:</strong> In your turn, you may also use your faction's unique racial ability. These are powerful tools, often overlooked in the heat of battle.</li>
            <li><strong>Passing:</strong> You may choose to take no actions on your turn and simply pass. This is a tactical decision. Sometimes, doing nothing is the most dangerous move of all.</li>
            <li><strong>Ending Your Turn:</strong> You must clearly and audibly declare the end of your turn. The next player cannot begin their turn until you have explicitly done so. No sneaky moves!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Game Rounds and Epic Events</h3>
        <p>
            A game round concludes when the last player in the turn order has completed their turn. The end of each round is always accompanied by an Epic Event. These are the Abyss's way of reminding you who's truly in charge.
        </p>

        <h3>Event Cards</h3>
        <p>
            At the end of each game round, the first player draws the top card from the Event Deck and reads its effects aloud.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Event Types:</strong> Events can be either <em>Instant</em> (their effect occurs immediately and is resolved, e.g., a rockfall) or <em>Ongoing</em> (their effect persists until the end of the current round).</li>
            <li><strong>Mandatory Effects:</strong> All effects described on an Event Card are mandatory and must be applied. The Abyss cares not for your plans.</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> If an Event Card's effect conflicts with a unit skill, terrain effect, or any other game rule, the Event Card's effect takes precedence unless otherwise specified on the card. The universe has its own rules, and they are not always convenient.</li>
            <li><strong>Deck Management:</strong> After an Event Card is resolved, it is discarded. If the Event Deck is depleted, shuffle the discard pile to form a new Event Deck. The cycle of chaos is endless.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <p>
            A unit's movement is expressed as the number of cells it can cover on the game board during its turn. This value is listed on the unit's card.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Starting Cell:</strong> The cell a unit begins its movement on is not counted towards its movement allowance.</li>
            <li><strong>Path Declaration:</strong> You must declare the intended path of your unit's movement before moving its token. No teleporting through walls unless you're a Chthonid and explicitly allowed!</li>
            <li><strong>Cell Effects:</strong> As a unit moves, it steps onto each cell in its path. If a cell has an active effect, that effect is triggered as the unit enters it. Players should carefully monitor active effects on the board. The ground itself can be your ally or your undoing.</li>
            <li><strong>Ending Movement:</strong> A unit's movement must always end on an unoccupied cell.</li>
            <li><strong>Blocking & Occupied Cells:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alive units cannot be moved through. They are inconveniently solid.</li>
                    <li>Cells containing wounded units are considered occupied. You may move through such cells, but you are forbidden from ending your movement on a cell occupied by a wounded unit. It's considered bad form, and also, they might still bite.</li>
                    <li>Movement onto or through Mountain or Water cells is generally prohibited unless a specific skill or effect explicitly allows it. Similarly, you cannot end your turn on a Mountain or Water cell. The Abyss is not a fan of shortcuts.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Teleportation:</strong> Instantaneous relocation from one point to another. Teleportation ignores all obstacles and effects on intervening or destination cells. A true Chthonid specialty, for those who laugh in the face of physics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploration</h3>
        <p>
            To explore a new area of the game board:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Position one of your units adjacent to a face-down Map Tile. "Adjacent" means sharing an edge.</li>
            <li>Declare that you have finished your turn.</li>
            <li>Immediately after your turn ends, the face-down Map Tile is revealed and placed face-up.
                <ul>
                    <li>Once a unit triggers exploration, it cannot move further or take any other actions during that turn. Curiosity killed the cat, and it might just wound your unit.</li>
                    <li>Any unit (excluding Savages), even accidentally, that happens to be on the border of a face-down segment will activate its exploration. The Abyss reveals itself when it's good and ready, or when you stumble into it.</li>
                    <li>If a unit is on the border of multiple face-down segments, all of those segments are revealed and activated simultaneously. A cascade of discovery... or disaster.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Terrain and Structures</h3>
        <p>
            The game board is composed of various terrain types and structures, each with unique properties that affect gameplay. Understanding these is paramount to survival; the land itself is a weapon.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mountains:</strong> Impassable terrain. Units cannot move onto or through Mountain cells. Ranged attacks cannot be made through Mountain cells. Units cannot end their turn on Mountain cells. Think of them as very large, inconvenient walls.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Impassable terrain. Movement on Water cells is prohibited. Units cannot end their turn on Water cells. Unless you're a Swamper, in which case, enjoy your soggy existence.</li>
            <li><strong>Forest:</strong> Each Forest cell entered by a unit reduces its movement allowance by 1 (e.g., if a unit has 3 movement and enters a Forest, it has 2 movement remaining). A dense, thorny embrace that slows even the swiftest.</li>
            <li><strong>Hills:</strong> Units on Hill cells gain +1 to the range of their Ranged attacks (e.g., a skill with 3 range becomes 4 range on a Hill). The high ground grants a clear shot, and a tactical advantage.</li>
            <li><strong>Fortification:</strong> Units in Fortification cells gain +1 to their melee attack rolls (e.g., a standard success on 4-5-6 becomes 3-4-5-6). A sturdy defense for those who prefer to meet their enemies up close and personal.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Site:</strong> Units in Power Site cells gain +1 to their Distortion skill rolls (e.g., a standard success on 4-6 becomes 3-6). These are places where the fabric of reality is thin, perfect for those who dabble in the arcane.</li>
            <li><strong>Cave:</strong> When a Cave cell is revealed during exploration, a Savage unit is spawned from the Savage Deck onto that cell. (See "Savages and Control" section). A dark maw from which primal horrors emerge.</li>
            <li><strong>Cradle:</strong> Units in Cradle cells gain +1 to their Summoning skill rolls (e.g., a standard success on 4-5-6 becomes 3-4-5-6). A nexus of life, or perhaps, unlife.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Savages and Control</h3>
        <p>
            Savages are the untamed, monstrous inhabitants of the Abyss. They are not to be underestimated, for their primal fury can turn the tide of battle, often unexpectedly. When a Cave cell is explored, a Savage is activated. Its token is placed on the Cave cell, and the player who explored the Cave takes the corresponding Savage card.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Savage Turn:</strong> A Savage immediately takes its turn after the player who activated it finishes their turn. If multiple Savages are active, they take their turns in clockwise order starting from the activating player. They are impatient creatures.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Determination:</strong> Before a Savage's turn, players determine who controls it for that turn. Measure the distance from the Savage to the closest unit of each player. The player whose closest unit is *further* from the Savage gains control for that round. If distances are equal, players roll a d6, and the highest roll gains control. It's a twisted game of "hot potato" with a monster.</li>
            <li><strong>Controlled Savage:</strong> A Savage under a player's control is considered part of that player's squad and adheres to all unit and squad rules. Treat them as a temporary, very grumpy ally.</li>
            <li><strong>Savage Restrictions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Savage cannot leave the map segment it was spawned on. They are creatures of habit, or perhaps, territoriality.</li>
                    <li>Savages attack the *closest* enemy unit within the range of their skills. If a controlling player's unit is equally close to an enemy unit, control of the Savage shifts to the other player. Their loyalty is fleeting, their hunger eternal.</li>
                    <li>Savages do not collect trophies from defeated units. Any trophies they would acquire are immediately discarded. If a Savage gained trophies while under a player's control, it discards them as soon as control is lost. They care not for trinkets, only for destruction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Control:</strong> If a Savage was previously under a player's control (e.g., via a "Parasites" skill) and that control is lost, the Savage becomes tethered to its current map segment. It will then take its turn at the end of the round, after all players have completed their actions. A wild beast unleashed, but still confined.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Combat and Unit States</h2>

        <h3>Wounds and Death</h3>
        <p>
            In Chibitactics, there's no need to track hit points or complex wound mechanics. Units are in one of three clear states:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alive:</strong> The unit is fully functional and can perform actions. Breathing, fighting, generally being a nuisance.</li>
            <li><strong>Wounded:</strong> The unit has taken damage and is immobilized, unable to use its skills. The unit's token is flipped to its wounded side. A crumpled heap, but still capable of being revived.</li>
            <li><strong>Dead:</strong> The unit is removed from the game board. Gone, but not forgotten... unless you forget them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Becoming Wounded</h4>
        <p>
            A unit becomes Wounded as a result of a successful attack or skill that explicitly states it causes a wound. It's a temporary setback, a mere flesh wound... usually.
        </p>

        <h4>Achieving Death</h4>
        <p>
            A Wounded unit can be "finished off" and removed from the game. When a unit dies, any trophies it held are returned to their respective decks. The unit card of the slain unit is then transferred as a trophy to the unit that delivered the killing blow (see "Trophies" section), provided the killer is within 3 cells of the defeated unit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wounded units can be finished off in several ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Melee Finish:</strong> If your unit is adjacent to a wounded enemy unit, you may declare at the start of your unit's turn that its action will be to "finish off" the target. The target is immediately destroyed, and your unit loses its turn. A swift, brutal end.</li>
            <li><strong>Skills:</strong> You may use unit skills on wounded units just as you would on healthy ones. If the skill is successfully applied, the wounded target is destroyed. Sometimes, a little overkill is just good strategy.</li>
            <li><strong>Events:</strong> Certain game events may cause wounded units to be destroyed. The Abyss has a way of cleaning up its own messes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Special Death Properties</h4>
        <p>
            Some units possess unique properties related to how they take damage or are removed from play:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fast Wound:</strong> For units with this property, a wound can be inflicted simply by spending a turn adjacent to them (you declare aloud that your unit is spending its turn to wound the target). An attack skill is not necessarily required. They're just that fragile, or perhaps, that tempting a target.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast Death:</strong> Units with "Fast Death" skip the wounded phase entirely and are immediately destroyed. Similar to "Fast Wound," you can destroy such a unit by spending a turn adjacent to it or by successfully applying a combat skill. No time for last rites, just a quick trip to the void.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Trophies</h3>
        <p>
            When your units defeat enemies on the map, they earn trophies. The unit that destroys a target collects its unit card as a trophy, provided the killer is within 3 cells of the defeated unit. The trophy card is placed face-down underneath the killer unit's own unit card. A unit can hold any number of trophies. Consider them morbid souvenirs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Captured trophies can be used to activate bonus effects, either before or after your unit's main action, without costing an additional action. They are echoes of fallen power, waiting to be unleashed.
        </p>

        <h4>Trophy Types</h4>
        <p>
            Each trophy card offers two potential effects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Substance:</strong> A close-range or self-targeting effect. Applies only when adjacent to the target or on self. These typically do not require a dice roll. Often a quick, dirty trick.</li>
            <li><strong>Totem:</strong> An effect that requires a dice roll to activate, mimicking a skill described on the trophy card. A more potent, but less reliable, burst of power.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Using Trophies</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>You must declare which trophy you are using and which effect (Substance or Totem) you are activating. Transparency is key, even in the shadows.</li>
            <li>You must show the trophy card to all other players.</li>
            <li>Only one trophy effect can be used per unit action.</li>
            <li>Using a trophy does not consume your unit's main action for the turn. It's a bonus, a little extra something for your troubles.</li>
            <li>After use (regardless of success), the trophy card is discarded to its original deck's discard pile. Power is fleeting in the Abyss.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Trading Trophies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A unit can trade a trophy to an adjacent squadmate without losing its turn. Share the spoils of war, or at least the tools of destruction.</li>
            <li>Trophies cannot be traded to Savages, summoned units, enemy units, or wounded units. Some things are simply not meant to be shared.</li>
            <li>Summoned units (those brought into play via "Summon" category skills) cannot acquire trophies. They are mere extensions, not true warriors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Unit Skills</h2>
        <p>
            Skills are the core of your units' capabilities and are listed on each unit's card. Mastering the strategic planning and application of these skills is key to victory in Chibitactics. Every skill has parameters that define how it is used and how it affects the environment, targets, players, and the caster.
        </p>

        <h3>Skill Activation</h3>
        <p>
            Once you've determined your tactics, you begin to activate your units' skills:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>You must declare aloud the skill you are using and its target (e.g., "I am using 'Fireball' against the Savage"). Leave no room for doubt.</li>
            <li>Then, roll the die (if the skill requires a roll). The fates are fickle.</li>
            <li>Finally, perform the actions specified in the skill's description or according to its category.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After using a skill, your unit typically cannot use further skills – its turn is concluded. However, specific skill categories, Event Cards, faction abilities, or other effects might allow a unit to retain or gain additional actions (e.g., Melee skills can be used after Movement skills). Always look for opportunities to maximize your impact!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Friendly Fire:</strong> Skill effects apply to all units within their range or radius, including your own squad members. Carefully choose the target cell for your skills, especially those with an "Area Effect" property, as they can be dangerous to your own forces. There's a fine line between a tactical strike and a self-inflicted wound.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Dice Roll Modifiers:</strong> Skills and trophies that provide bonuses to dice rolls (e.g., "+1 to dice roll") apply only to the *very next* dice roll made. Subsequent rolls are not affected by this bonus unless another modifier is applied. Don't get greedy with your luck.
        </p>

        <h3>Skill Categories</h3>
        <p>
            All unit skills fall into specific categories. A skill's category defines its basic use, default effects, and when it can or cannot be used. Categories are often represented by icons on unit cards. It's important to note that if a skill's specific description conflicts with its category or general properties, the **skill's description takes precedence.**
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Dice Roll Indication:</strong> The numbers on the die icon indicate the required roll for skill activation. If no die roll is indicated, refer to the skill category's description and its standard properties. Some skills do not require a dice roll, and there is a separate category for Passive skills.
        </p>

        <h4>Movement Skills</h4>
        <p>
            These skills allow a unit to traverse the game board. The number of cells a unit can move is indicated in the skill's description.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cell a unit starts on is not counted towards its movement.</li>
            <li>Units are generally forbidden from stopping or moving through Mountains or Water (unless other effects dictate otherwise).</li>
            <li>Movement must end on an unoccupied cell. Cells with wounded units are considered occupied; you can move through them but not end your turn on them.</li>
            <li>During movement, you must count each cell and declare the path your unit is taking. If a cell has an effect, it triggers as the unit enters it.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Properties:</strong> None.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Melee Combat Skills</h4>
        <p>
            Used for close-quarters combat.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requires the unit to be immediately adjacent to the target.</li>
            <li>Requires a dice roll.</li>
            <li>Skills in this category can be activated after using a Movement skill in the same turn.</li>
            <li>Units with Melee skills "Bind" units they are adjacent to (see "Bind" property).</li>
            <li>Upon a successful dice roll, the target is Wounded (or suffers another effect as described on the card).</li>
            <li>Melee skills gain a +1 bonus to their dice roll when used from a Fortification cell.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Success Roll:</strong> 4-5-6 (on a d6).</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Range:</strong> 1 (adjacent).</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Properties:</strong> Action After Movement, Bind.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ranged Combat Skills</h4>
        <p>
            Used for attacks at a distance.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requires a clear line of sight to the target; there must be no Mountain cells between the attacker and target. Line of sight is blocked by the first unit in the way.</li>
            <li>Requires a dice roll.</li>
            <li>Upon a successful dice roll, the target is Wounded (or suffers another effect as described on the card).</li>
            <li>Ranged skills gain a +1 bonus to their range when used from a Hill cell.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Success Roll:</strong> 4-5-6 (on a d6).</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Range:</strong> 2+ (specific range indicated in the skill description).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Distortion Skills</h4>
        <p>
            These skills represent magical or psionic effects, manipulating matter, space, and even time.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically require a dice roll for activation.</li>
            <li>Can be positive or negative in effect.</li>
            <li>The skill description usually provides full information on its operation (e.g., Fireballs, Teleportation, Mind Control).</li>
            <li>The target can be any cell or unit, including the skill's caster.</li>
            <li>Distortion skills can be used even if the unit is "bound."</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Success Roll:</strong> 4-5-6 (on a d6).</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Range:</strong> 0 (self-targeting), unless otherwise specified on the unit card.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Summoning Skills</h4>
        <p>
            Allows you to bring new units onto the map, according to the character's skills and faction features.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically requires you to specify an unoccupied target cell for the summoned unit's creation.</li>
            <li>The summoned unit is usually placed on a cell adjacent to the summoning unit (unless otherwise specified on the card).</li>
            <li>A summoned unit immediately takes its turn after appearing on the map.</li>
            <li>Summoned creatures cannot acquire or carry trophies.</li>
            <li>Summoning skills gain a +1 bonus to their dice roll when used from a Cradle cell.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Success Roll:</strong> 4-5-6 (on a d6).</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Range:</strong> 1 (adjacent).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Buff Skills</h4>
        <p>
            Buffs provide additional enhancements to a unit, but must be used carefully.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the dice roll for a buff is unsuccessful, the unit's turn immediately ends.</li>
            <li>If the dice roll is successful, the unit can continue its turn and use any of its other skills, *except another buff skill*.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Range:</strong> 0 (self-targeting), unless otherwise specified on the unit card.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Properties:</strong> One-Time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Passive Skills</h4>
        <p>
            Passive skills are innate abilities of units.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>This category does not require activation or target selection.</li>
            <li>The conditions for these skills are always met by default.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Range:</strong> 0 (self-targeting), unless otherwise specified on the unit card.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skill Properties and Keywords (Detailed)</h3>
        <p>
            Any skill can possess one or more additional properties. These properties supplement the skill, providing a more complete understanding of its behavior. Properties are described in the skill descriptions. Standard properties are listed at the end of each skill category.
        </p>

        <h3>Skill Properties</h3>
        <p>
            Any skill can possess one or more additional properties. Properties supplement the skill, providing a more complete understanding of its behavior. Properties are described in skill descriptions. Standard properties are described at the end of categories.
        </p>

        <h4>Range</h4>
        <p>
            The distance (number of cells) at which a skill can be applied. The target must be within the skill's range. The range count starts from the cell next to the unit using the skill. If there is a cell (or part of a cell) with a mountain on the direct path to the target, then the target is unreachable.
        </p>

        <h4>Radius</h4>
        <p>
            Such skills affect each cell within the radius. A skill with this property is applied separately for each target caught within the skill's radius. The area of effect is calculated from the point where the skill was successfully directed + radius around the cell.
        </p>

        <h4>Bind</h4>
        <p>
            While a unit is in the zone of effect (determined by properties) of a skill with this property, it is bound. If a bound target attempts to use movement, summoning, or ranged combat - the current skill is applied out of turn and before the target's skill (i.e., the action of a bound unit may end with a wound).
        </p>

        <h4>Area Effect</h4>
        <p>
            Skills with this property affect the entire area. You don't need to roll a die for each target in the skill's area of effect. The skill's effect applies to all targets simultaneously in this zone.
        </p>

        <h4>Action After Movement</h4>
        <p>
            Skills with this property can be used after the unit has used Movement category skills.
        </p>

        <h4>One-Time</h4>
        <p>
            The effect of such a skill will last until the next turn of the unit that applied this skill. The effect of a one-time skill stops working as soon as the player declares the use of the unit's skills. Moreover, the effect dissipates, and only then does the effect of the new skill take effect.
        </p>

        <h4>Persistent</h4>
        <p>
            Effects from persistent skills will work until the creator cancels the effect, is wounded, or is dispelled by other effects.
        </p>

        <h4>Cancellation</h4>
        <p>
            Canceling the effect of a persistent skill or summoned creature is a full turn. To cancel (as well as to create) requires spending a full turn of the unit.
        </p>

        <h2>Factions of Chibitactics</h2>
        <p>
            The Abyss is a tapestry woven from disparate realities, and its inhabitants are as varied as the nightmares that haunt the edges of sanity. Each faction in Chibitactics offers a unique philosophy, a distinct approach to survival, and a specialized set of tools for dominance. Choosing your faction is not merely selecting a color; it is embracing a destiny. Will you wield ancient, reality-bending powers, command a fungal horde, deploy the cold precision of human technology, or embrace the raw, untamed savagery of the Abyss itself?

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Choosing Your First Faction:</strong>

        <h2>The Ancient Chthonids</h2>
        <p>
            Once akin to deities, the Chthonids possessed the power to manipulate reality itself, shaping the environment according to their capricious will. Yet, an existence of unbridled power and serenity softened and weakened this ancient race. They stirred the cosmos less and less with their grand displays, venturing ever more infrequently from their hidden sanctuaries. Ultimately, they found solace in the fertile world of the Abyss, descending into its deepest chasms to enter a profound state of anabiosis. It seemed nothing could disturb their slumber... until now.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ancient Chthonids wield formidable distortion abilities, capable of influencing matter, space, and even time. Their singular purpose is destruction, transforming ruins into something new, only for that new creation to be shattered once more. Chaos – raw, unbridled chaos – is their lifeblood. Will the Abyss finally succumb to the might of the Ancients and become building material for new worlds? Or will it stand defiant against the forces that seek to unravel its very fabric?
        </p>

        <h4>Racial Ability: Teleportation</h4>
        <p>
            Once per turn, by rolling a d6 and achieving a result of 3, 4, 5, or 6, a Chthonid unit from your squad can be **teleported** up to 3 cells away from its initial position without losing its turn.
        </p>
        <div class="clarification">
            <em>Teleportation is an instantaneous transfer from one point to another. Obstacles or effects on the cells along the path or at the destination are ignored for the purpose of the teleport itself. You simply cease to be here, and then are there.</em>
        </div>
        <div class="tactical-tip">
            <strong>Insight:</strong> This racial ability is the cornerstone of Chthonid strategy. Use it to bypass enemy lines, quickly reinforce a threatened flank, or snatch objectives. It's also a fantastic escape tool for a wounded unit.

                <em>A grotesque duality, two minds bound by an unspeakable pact, forever echoing each other's pain and triumph. They move as one, yet are two, a paradox of flesh and will. Some say they were once lovers, cursed to share a single, tormented existence. Others claim they are merely the Abyss's cruel joke. Either way, they're surprisingly good at synchronized disembowelment.</em>

        <h2>The Fungoids</h2>
        <p>
            A race of beings inhabiting the Abyss since the dawn of its existence. After world-altering events, the Fungoids were scattered across the planet, severing their intricate informational networks. This led to the formation of several large and numerous small enclaves. These enclaves were forced to act independently, yet their ultimate goal remained unchanged: to weave a network across the entire world, not caring about the complexities introduced by foreign biomass. Large enclaves now exist on different sides of the planet, separated by vast distances and enemies. Each enclave received the same fundamental knowledge base from their global ancestor, but each found itself in a unique environment, and lacking connections, each developed its own distinct evolutionary path. They are the silent, creeping conquerors, and their spores will eventually cover everything. Resistance is, as they say, futile.
        </p>

        <h4>Racial Ability: Spore Rebirth</h4>
        <p>
            Once per round, by rolling a d6 and achieving a result of 3, 4, 5, or 6, a player can replace a wounded Fungoid unit from their squad with any Fungoid unit from their faction deck. The newly spawned unit immediately takes its turn.
        </p>
        <div class="tactical-tip">
            <strong>Insight:</strong> This is a powerful recovery and tactical flexibility tool. Use it to bring a fresh, healthy unit into play, or to swap in a unit with a skill better suited to the current situation. It allows Fungoids to maintain board presence even after taking heavy losses.
        </div>

        <h4>Faction Feature: Organic Vulnerability</h4>
        <p>
            Units of this faction can be wounded without using explicit attacking skills; simply ending a turn adjacent to them is enough to cause a wound. (Player declares aloud that their unit is spending its turn to wound the target).
        </p>
        <div class="humor-quote">
            <em>"They're not weak, they're... absorbent. And a little squishy. But mostly absorbent. Just try not to get too close, unless you enjoy being a compost heap." - A Human Scout, moments before being engulfed by a fungal growth.</em>
        </div>
        <div class="tactical-tip">
            <strong>Insight:</strong> Be mindful of this vulnerability when positioning your Fungoid units. Keep them away from strong melee units or use their control skills to keep enemies at bay. This encourages a more defensive or controlling playstyle.
        </div>

        <h4>Control Skill Mechanics</h4>
        <p>
            When a unit is captured by a Fungoid control skill, it cannot move until the next round. Control is lost if the controlling Fungoid unit is wounded or if the controlled unit moves beyond the control range (which is equal to the skill's range, as indicated on the Fungoid unit's card).
        </p>
        <div class="tactical-tip">
            <strong>Insight:</strong> Control skills are the Fungoids' bread and butter. Use them to disable key enemy units, turn foes against each other, or simply prevent them from reaching objectives. Mastering their range and duration is key to a successful Fungoid strategy.
        </div>

        <h2>The Humans</h2>
        <p>
            The Dominion of the British Empire, an outpost of humanity, represents a technocratic, militaristic society. It serves as a launching pad for the conquest of alien worlds. A new landscape, unknown life forms, fossils with unpredictable reactive effects, and an aggressive living environment failed to break the Dominion. The exploratory spirit of its scientists and humanity's eternal thirst for development not only adapted mankind to the "Abyss" but also, through access to new fundamental elements of world-building, allowed humanity to reach a fundamentally new level of development, unveiling boundless possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The human race possesses knowledge of steam and electrical technologies. The ruling powers within the Dominion are divided into various clan groupings, each specializing in different technological or tactical doctrines. They are the masters of precision, the architects of destruction, and the purveyors of stiff upper lips in the face of cosmic horror. And they always have a plan, even if it involves blowing up half the map.
        </p>

        <h4>Racial Ability: Tactical Relocation</h4>
        <p>
            Each human unit has the ability to transfer its turn to an allied human unit. The target must be a unit from the Human faction and must be within 3 cells. A d6 roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 is required for this transfer to succeed. The unit that transfers its turn loses its current turn.
        </p>
        <div class="tactical-tip">
            <strong>Insight:</strong> This is an excellent way to activate your most powerful units multiple times in a round, or to get a crucial unit into position for a decisive blow. Prioritize transferring turns to units that can make the biggest impact, like a Ballistician or Sniper.

        <h2>The Savages</h2>
        <p>
            The Savages are an indigenous, wild, and unpredictable force within the Abyss. Rooted deeply in the raw energies of this strange new world, they embody primal power and fierce resilience. Their connection to the untamed environment grants them unique adaptations and a terrifying, often chaotic, array of abilities. They are not merely beasts but sentient beings, though their methods and motives often remain a mystery to the more "civilized" factions. Their ferocity in combat is legendary, and their unexpected tactics can turn the tide of any engagement. They are the Abyss's true natives, and they don't appreciate intruders. Especially not the ones who try to "civilize" them.
        </p>
        <div class="dark-fantasy-quote">
            <em>"Do not mistake their primal nature for ignorance. The Savages understand the Abyss in ways we can only dream of. And they will use that understanding to tear you limb from limb." - A captured Human researcher.</em>
        </div>

        <h4>Racial Ability: Primal Resilience</h4>
        <p>
            When a Savage unit is wounded, there is a chance (on a d6 roll of 4, 5, or 6) that it will automatically recover 1 wound at the start of its next turn, or gain a temporary bonus to its next action due to its inherent wild vitality. This can happen once per unit per round.
        </p>
        <div class="tactical-tip">
            <strong>Insight:</strong> This makes Savages surprisingly resilient. Don't assume a wounded Savage is out of the fight! Prioritize finishing them off if you want them gone for good, as they can quickly bounce back.
        </div>

                <em>A hulking, regenerating brute, the Shambler is a force of nature, slowly but inexorably advancing, shrugging off wounds that would fell lesser creatures. Its bone-crushing blows are legendary, and its persistence is terrifying. It's like a zombie, but with better dental hygiene and a surprising knack for self-repair.</em>
